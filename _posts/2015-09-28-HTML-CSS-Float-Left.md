Today we have begun working on HTML and CSS - here is one of the concepts that I found interesting. It is how to display elements next to each other without changing the display to inline. It is using float:left

Here's my HTML code:

![My html code]({{ site.url}}/img/codeshot1.png)

This was linked to the following CSS code:

![css code]({{ site.url}}/img/codeshot2.png)

And here is the result:

![Divs display floated]({{ site.url}}/img/webshot.png)
