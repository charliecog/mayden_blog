I had a few minutes to have a messaround and practice my CSS so I decided to try something which I have previously attempted and failed before I started the Mayden Academy to see if I could apply my new found skills to successfully navigate the problem.  

I wanted to create a hexagon, then position 4 hexagons into a honeycomb shaped module and then be able to repeat the pattern as many times as I wanted.

I created the hexagon by utilising "position:absolute" and adding two triangles (one inverted) to either side of a square. I then created 4 in a row and positioned them. After this I created more modules and floated them left to align them alongside each other and was sure to check the overflow was visible. Now this module has been created, I am able to add as many or as little honeycombs to my "beehive" as I want!
