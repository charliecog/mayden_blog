      <p>The first week has flown by and I am currently taking stock of what I have learnt this week at the Mayden academy. To say that I am further on than I thought I would be at this point would be an understatement! There has been a great learning pace throughout the first week and all 6 of us academy trainees have been extremely enthusiastic to push on with getting through the content of the course. This has been a really refreshing learning environment to be a part of and has encouraged all of us to make a real effort with absorbing as much information as possible.</p>

<p>The first couple of days were spent getting used to our new development laptops - I hadn’t ever used a mac for any serious stretch of time so getting my head around the OS has been and will continue to be an area I am making a concerted effort with. It sounds like I should have it cracked within a couple of weeks so I am not too worried.</p>

<p>Making the changeover from Windows to Mac aside, we have spent time getting used to the way the company works - the particular software that is used for project management, timekeeping and task delivery. Like everything else I learn by repetition and I am already finding it easier to use with only a weeks use under my belt.</p>

<p>The Mayden software engineering teams, as well as a large portion of the digital teams all over the world, use a working methodolgy called agile. We watched a few videos, had a discussion and then sat in on an actual agile meeting within the business. This is to open our eyes to the fact that developing software is not just about coding - the ability to work effectively in a team is just as important. The particular type of Agile that we are learning is called scrum and its definately worth a google.</p>

<p>The second half of the week we spent our time getting our teeth into some slightly more technical stuff, which if I am honest, I was quite glad for. We covered GIT (the version control system) GITHUB (the frontend for using GIT), trying out multiple IDE’s (text editors) using the command line, writing simple bash scripts to customize our working environment, setting up local servers, an intoduction to how the web works and finally setting up this very blog using Jekyll and hosting on GITHUB to practice all of these skills.</p>

<p>There has been alot to cover in only a few days but I have found myself really encouraged with the amount of information absorbed. Even writing this blog has made me realise just how much stuff the trainers have covered. Im excited about getting back in on Monday morning and continuing to climb the learning curve, although I suspect it will get steeper and steeper as the weeks go on!</p>
