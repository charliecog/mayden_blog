    <h1 class="title">CREATE A HONEYCOMB WITH CSS</h1>
    <p class="date">OCT 1, 2015</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blogcontent">
    <p>I had a few minutes to have a messaround and practice my CSS so I decided to try something which I have previously attempted and failed before I started the Mayden Academy to see if I could apply my new found skills to successfully navigate the problem.</p>
    <p>I wanted to create a hexagon, then position 4 hexagons into a honeycomb shaped module and then be able to repeat the pattern as many times as I wanted.</p>
    <p>I created the hexagon by utilising position:absolute and adding two triangles (one inverted) to either side of a square. I then created 4 in a row and positioned them. After this I created more modules and floated them left to align them alongside each other and was sure to check the overflow was visible. Now this module has been created, I am able to add as many or as little honeycombs to my beehive as I want!</p>
